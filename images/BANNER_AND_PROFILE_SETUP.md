# Banner and Profile Photo Setup

To complete the enhanced hero section on your portfolio, you'll need to add two image files:

## Required Images

### 1. Banner Image (`images/banner.jpg`)
- **Purpose**: Background image for the hero banner section
- **Recommended Size**: 1920x500 pixels (or similar 16:5 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Content**: Professional DevOps-themed background (servers, code, networks, etc.)
- **Note**: The image will be darkened with an overlay, so it should have good contrast

### 2. Profile Photo (`images/profile.jpg`)
- **Purpose**: Professional headshot displayed in the hero section
- **Recommended Size**: 400x400 pixels (square aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Content**: Professional headshot or avatar
- **Note**: Will be displayed as a circular image with border

## How to Add Your Images

1. Save your banner image as `images/banner.jpg`
2. Save your profile photo as `images/profile.jpg`
3. The website will automatically display them in the enhanced hero section

## Alternative Options

If you don't have these images yet, you can:

1. **Use existing images**: Rename any suitable images you have
2. **Create placeholders**: Use a solid color background for testing
3. **Professional photos**: Consider getting professional DevOps-themed photos taken

## Current Status

The HTML and CSS are already configured to use these images. Once you add them to the `images/` folder, they will automatically appear on your website.

## Testing

You can test the layout with placeholder images first:
- Banner: Any landscape image (even a screenshot of your desktop)
- Profile: Any square photo (even a generic avatar)

The layout is responsive and will look great on all devices!
